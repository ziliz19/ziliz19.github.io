                                            <p>The global aging population is increasing, leading to changes in the pattern of medical care. Service design, which focuses on exploring user behavior and feelings from different angles and puts the user at the center, is gaining attention to improve medical care in addition to professional medical research. </p>
                                            <h3>Objectives</h3>

                                                <blockquote>
                                                    This study found that traditional methods do not provide enough depth or diversity in understanding users' problems. The process of service design produces results such as Stakeholders map, How Might We (HMW), and Storyboard can provide deeper and more diverse insights. The study specifically analysis the HMW generated during the workshop and proposes needs for elderly care.

                                            <p>The workshop was specifically designed to facilitate both divergent and convergent thinking exercises. The participants were guided through a series of exercises, which included A.E.I.O.U obeservation, stakeholder map, and others. Through these exercises,  we gathered an extensive amount of data and information.  Each item is worthy of in-depth analysis and exploration, and this study focuses on conducting further analysis on "HMW".</p>

                                            <p>A total of 269 HMW statements were employed for further exploration. The elements of "Who," "When," and "What" were deconstructed into four categories: Characteristics, Role, Field, and Issues and Needs. Each category was subjected to the KJ method for further classification and analysis.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Elderly: </strong>The elderly have diverse characteristics, including various lifestyles, physiological and psychological statuses, and behavioral tendencies. They face various problems and needs at home and in hospitals, such as medication management, communication, and access to timely medical support.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Family Members: </strong>Family members involved in caregiving for the elderly face various characteristics. They face challenges: unfamiliarity with hospitals, work conflicts, meeting parent's needs, diet concerns, safety worries, seeking support, subsidy understanding, personal well-being, family conflicts.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Healthcare Providers: </strong>Healthcare providers require improved communication with family members, effective health education, and adequate personnel support. </p>
                                            <p><strong>External Caregivers: </strong>External caregivers need efficient onboarding, smooth communication, work-life balance, improved hospital visits, vacation time.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Other Stakeholders: </strong>The workshop examined various individuals involved in the lives of older adults, such as village chiefs, neighbors, and government personnel. Their problems and needs include understanding older adults' conditions, ensuring assistance, applying for subsidies, designing suitable living spaces.</p>
                                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                            <p>The findings of the research highlight the potential of Human-Centered Design methods in the medical sector to better comprehend the needs and wants of healthcare service users. This method provides an insightful framework to identify the various pain points experienced by the elderly patients, their families, and other stakeholders, thus enabling them to tailor their services to meet their unique requirements. Additionally, this study under-scores the significance of considering the diverse viewpoints of all stakeholders when developing and implementing healthcare solutions for older adults. By embracing this user-centric approach, healthcare providers can create more effective and personalized services that cater to the specific needs of elderly individuals and enhance their overall quality of life.</p>
